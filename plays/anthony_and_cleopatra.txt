<ACT 1>


<SCENE 1>
<Alexandria. A Room in Cleopatra's Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Demetrius and Philo.>
</STAGE DIR>
<PHILO>	<0%>
	Nay, but this dotage of our general's
	O'erflows the measure; those his goodly eyes,
	That o'er the files and musters of the war
	Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn
	The office and devotion of their view
	Upon a tawny front; his captain's heart,
	Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
	The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
	And is become the bellows and the fan
	To cool a gipsy's lust. Look! where they come.

<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. Enter Antony and Cleopatra, with their Trains; Eunuchs fanning her.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Take but good note, and you shall see in him
	The triple pillar of the world transform'd
</PHILO>
	Into a strumpet's fool; behold and see.
<CLEOPATRA>	<1%>
	If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
	There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<1%>
	I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
	Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter an Attendant.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ATTENDANT>	<1%>
	News, my good lord, from Rome.
</ATTENDANT>

<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
	Grates me; the sum.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<1%>
	Nay, hear them, Antony:
	Fulvia, perchance, is angry; or, who knows
	If the scarce-bearded Cæsar have not sent
	His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
	Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
	Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
	How, my love!
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<1%>
	Perchance! nay, and most like;
	You must not stay here longer; your dismission
	Is come from Cæsar; therefore hear it, Antony.
	Where's Fulvia's process? Cæsar's I would say? both?
	Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
	Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
	Is Cæsar's homager; else so thy cheek pays shame
	When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<1%>
	Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
	Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
	Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
	Feeds beast as man; the nobleness of life
	Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
<STAGE DIR>
<Embracing.>
</STAGE DIR>
	And such a twain can do 't, in which I bind,
	On pain of punishment, the world to weet
	We stand up peerless.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<2%>
	Excellent falsehood!
	Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her?
	I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
	Will be himself.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<2%>
	But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
	Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
	Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
	There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
	Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<2%>
	Hear the ambassadors.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<2%>
	Fie, wrangling queen!
	Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
	To weep; whose every passion fully strives
	To make itself, in thee, fair and admir'd.
	No messenger, but thine; and all alone,
	To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
	The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
	Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Antony and Cleopatra, with their Train.>
</STAGE DIR>

<DEMETRIUS>	<2%>
	Is Cæsar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
</DEMETRIUS>

<PHILO>	<2%>
	Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
	He comes too short of that great property
	Which still should go with Antony.
</PHILO>

<DEMETRIUS>	<2%>
	I am full sorry
	That he approves the common liar, who
	Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
	Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
</DEMETRIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>

</SCENE 1>


<SCENE 2>
<The Same. Another Room.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Charmian, Iras, Alexas, and a Soothsayer.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CHARMIAN>	<2%>
	Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen? O! that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands.
</CHARMIAN>

<ALEXAS>	<3%>
	Soothsayer!
</ALEXAS>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
	Your will?
</SOOTHSAYER>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
</CHARMIAN>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
	In nature's infinite book of secrecy
	A little I can read.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<ALEXAS>	<3%>
	Show him your hand.

</ALEXAS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ENOBARBUS>	<3%>
	Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
	Cleopatra's health to drink.
</ENOBARBUS>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Good sir, give me good fortune.
</CHARMIAN>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
	I make not, but foresee.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Pray then, foresee me one.
</CHARMIAN>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
	You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	He means in flesh.
</CHARMIAN>

<IRAS>	<3%>
	No, you shall paint when you are old.
</IRAS>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Wrinkles forbid!
</CHARMIAN>

<ALEXAS>	<3%>
	Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
</ALEXAS>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Hush!
</CHARMIAN>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
	You shall be more beloving than belov'd.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
</CHARMIAN>

<ALEXAS>	<3%>
	Nay, hear him.
</ALEXAS>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all; let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage; find me to marry me with Octavius Cæsar, and companion me with my mistress.
</CHARMIAN>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
	You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
</CHARMIAN>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
	You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
	Than that which is to approach.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Then, belike, my children shall have no names; prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
</CHARMIAN>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<3%>
	If every of your wishes had a womb,
	And fertile every wish, a million.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
	Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
</CHARMIAN>

<ALEXAS>	<4%>
	You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
</ALEXAS>

<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
	Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
</CHARMIAN>

<ALEXAS>	<4%>
	We'll know all our fortunes.
</ALEXAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<4%>
	Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be,—drunk to bed.
</ENOBARBUS>

<IRAS>	<4%>
	There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
</IRAS>

<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
	E'en as the overflowing Nilus presageth famine.
</CHARMIAN>

<IRAS>	<4%>
	Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
</IRAS>

<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
	Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.
	Prithee, tell her but a worky-day fortune.
</CHARMIAN>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<4%>
	Your fortunes are alike.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<IRAS>	<4%>
	But how? but how? give me particulars.
</IRAS>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<4%>
	I have said.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<IRAS>	<4%>
	Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
</IRAS>

<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
	Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
</CHARMIAN>

<IRAS>	<4%>
	Not in my husband's nose.
</IRAS>

<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
	Our worser thoughts heaven mend! Alexas,—come, his fortune, his fortune. O! let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee; and let her die too, and give him a worse; and let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
</CHARMIAN>

<IRAS>	<4%>
	Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! for, as it is a heart-breaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
</IRAS>

<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
	Amen.
</CHARMIAN>

<ALEXAS>	<5%>
	Lo, now! if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold, they would make themselves whores, but they'd do't!
</ALEXAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<5%>
	Hush! here comes Antony.
</ENOBARBUS>

<CHARMIAN>	<5%>
	Not he; the queen.

</CHARMIAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cleopatra.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
	Saw you my lord?
</CLEOPATRA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<5%>
	No, lady.
</ENOBARBUS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
	Was he not here?
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<5%>
	No, madam.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
	He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
	A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
</CLEOPATRA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<5%>
	Madam!
</ENOBARBUS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
	Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
</CLEOPATRA>

<ALEXAS>	<5%>
	Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

</ALEXAS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Antony, with a Messenger and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<5%>
	We will not look upon him; go with us.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Alexas, Iras, Charmian, Soothsayer, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>

<MESSENGER>	<5%>
	Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
</MESSENGER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<5%>
	Against my brother Lucius?
</MARK ANTONY>

<MESSENGER>	<5%>
	Ay:
	But soon that war had end, and the time's state
	Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Cæsar,
	Whose better issue in the war, from Italy
	Upon the first encounter drave them.
</MESSENGER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<5%>
	Well, what worst?
</MARK ANTONY>

<MESSENGER>	<5%>
	The nature of bad news infects the teller.
</MESSENGER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<5%>
	When it concerns the fool, or coward. On;
	Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
	Who tells me true, though in his tale lay death,
	I hear him as he flatter'd.
</MARK ANTONY>

<MESSENGER>	<5%>
	Labienus—
	This is stiff news—hath, with his Parthian force
	Extended Asia; from Euphrates
	His conquering banner shook from Syria
	To Lydia and to Ionia: whilst—
</MESSENGER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<5%>
	Antony, thou wouldst say,—
</MARK ANTONY>

<MESSENGER>	<5%>
	O! my lord.
</MESSENGER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
	Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue;
	Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
	Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
	With such full licence as both truth and malice
	Have power to utter. O! then we bring forth weeds
	When our quick winds lie still; and our ills told us
	Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
</MARK ANTONY>

<MESSENGER>	<6%>
	At your noble pleasure.
</MESSENGER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
	From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
</MARK ANTONY>

<ATTENDANT 1>	<6%>
	The man from Sicyon, is there such an one?
</ATTENDANT 1>

<ATTENDANT 2>	<6%>
	He stays upon your will.
</ATTENDANT 2>

<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
	Let him appear.
	These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
	Or lose myself in dotage.

</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter another Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
	What are you?
<MESSENGER 2>	<6%>
	Fulvia thy wife is dead.
</MESSENGER 2>

<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
	Where died she?
</MARK ANTONY>

<MESSENGER 2>	<6%>
	In Sicyon:
	Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
	Importeth thee to know, this bears.
</MESSENGER 2>
<STAGE DIR>
<Giving a letter.>
</STAGE DIR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
	Forbear me.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Second Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
	There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
	What our contempts do often hurl from us
	We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
	By revolution lowering, does become
	The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
	The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
	I must from this enchanting queen break off;
	Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
	My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!

</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ENOBARBUS>	<6%>
	What's your pleasure, sir?
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<6%>
	I must with haste from hence.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<6%>
	Why, then, we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
	I must be gone.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Under a compelling occasion let women die; it were pity to cast them away for nothing; though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
	She is cunning past man's thought.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Alack! sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
	Would I had never seen her!
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	O, sir! you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
	Fulvia is dead.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Sir?
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
	Fulvia is dead.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Fulvia!
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<7%>
	Dead.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their de ties to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<8%>
	The business she hath broached in the state
	Cannot endure my absence.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<8%>
	And the business you have broached here cannot be without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<8%>
	No more light answers. Let our officers Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
	The cause of our expedience to the queen,
	And get her leave to part. For not alone
	The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
	Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too
	Of many our contriving friends in Rome
	Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
	Hath given the dare to Cæsar, and commands
	The empire of the sea; our slippery people—
	Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
	Till his deserts are past—begin to throw
	Pompey the Great and all his dignities
	Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
	Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
	For the main soldier, whose quality, going on,
	The sides o' the world may danger. Much is breeding,
	Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
	And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
	To such whose place is under us, requires
	Our quick remove from hence.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<8%>
	I shall do it.
</ENOBARBUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>

</SCENE 2>


<SCENE 3>
<The Same. Another Room.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<8%>
	Where is he?
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<8%>
	I did not see him since.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<8%>
	See where he is, who's with him, what he does;
	I did not send you: if you find him sad,
	Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
	That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Alexas.>
</STAGE DIR>

<CHARMIAN>	<9%>
	Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
	You do not hold the method to enforce
	The like from him.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
	What should I do I do not?
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<9%>
	In each thing give him way, cross him in nothing.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
	Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<9%>
	Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
	In time we hate that which we often fear.
	But here comes Antony.

</CHARMIAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Antony.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
	I am sick and sullen.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
	I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,—
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
	Help me away, dear Charmian, I shall fall:
	It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
	Will not sustain it.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
	Now, my dearest queen,—
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
	Pray you, stand further from me.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
	What's the matter?
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
	I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
	What says the married woman? You may go:
	Would she had never given you leave to come!
	Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here;
	I have no power upon you; hers you are.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
	The gods best know,—
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
	O! never was there queen
	So mightily betray'd; yet at the first
	I saw the treasons planted.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
	Cleopatra,—
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
	Why should I think you can be mine and true,
	Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
	Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
	To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
	Which break themselves in swearing!
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<9%>
	Most sweet queen,—
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<9%>
	Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
	But bid farewell, and go: when you su'd staying
	Then was the time for words; no going then:
	Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
	Bliss in our brows bent; none our parts so poor
	But was a race of heaven; they are so still,
	Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
	Art turn'd the greatest liar.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<10%>
	How now, lady!
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<10%>
	I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
	There were a heart in Egypt.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<10%>
	Hear me, queen:
	The strong necessity of time commands
	Our services awhile, but my full heart
	Remains in use with you. Our Italy
	Shines o'er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius
	Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
	Equality of two domestic powers
	Breeds scrupulous faction. The hated, grown to strength,
	Are newly grown to love; the condemn'd Pompey,
	Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
	Into the hearts of such as have not thriv'd
	Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
	And quietness, grown aick of rest, would purge
	By any desperate change. My more particular,
	And that which most with you should safe my going,
	Is Fulvia's death.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<10%>
	Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
	It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<10%>
	She's dead, my queen:
	Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
	The garboils she awak'd; at the last, best,
	See when and where she died.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<10%>
	O most false love!
	Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
	With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
	In Fulvia's death, how mine receiv'd shall be.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<10%>
	Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
	The purposes I bear, which are or cease
	As you shall give the advice. By the fire
	That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
	Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
	As thou affect'st.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
	Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
	But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well;
	So Antony loves.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
	My precious queen, forbear,
	And give true evidence to his love which stands
	An honourable trial.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
	So Fulvia told me.
	I prithee, turn aside and weep for her;
	Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
	Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
	Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
	Like perfect honour.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
	You'll heat my blood; no more.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
	You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
	Now, by my sword,—
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
	And target. Still he mends;
	But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
	How this Herculean Roman does become

<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
	I'll leave you, lady.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
	Courteous lord, one word.
	Sir, you and I must part, but that 's not it:
	Sir, you and I have lov'd, but there 's not it;
	That you know well: something it is I would,—
	O! my oblivion is a very Antony,
	And I am all forgotten.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
	But that your royalty
	Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
	For idleness itself.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<11%>
	'Tis sweating labour
	To bear such idleness so near the heart
	As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
	Since my becomings kill me when they do not
	Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
	Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
	And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
	Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
	Be strew'd before your feet!
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<11%>
	Let us go. Come;
	Our separation so abides and flies,
	That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
	And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
	Away!
</MARK ANTONY>

<SCENE 4>
<Rome. A Room in Cæsar's House.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Octavius Cæsar, Lepidus, and Attendants.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CÆSAR>	<12%>
	You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
	It is not Cæsar's natural vice to hate
	Our great competitor. From Alexandria
	This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
	The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
	Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
	More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
	Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners: you shall find there
	A man who is the abstract of all faults
	That all men follow.
</CÆSAR>

<LEPIDUS>	<12%>
	I must not think there are
	Evils enow to darken all his goodness;
	His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
	More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
	Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
	Than what he chooses.
</LEPIDUS>

<CÆSAR>	<12%>
	You are too indulgent. Let us grant it is not
	Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
	To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
	And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
	To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
	With knaves that smell of sweat; say this becomes him,—
	As his composure must be rare indeed
	Whom these things cannot blemish,—yet must Antony
	No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
	So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
	His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
	Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
	Call on him for 't; but to confound such time
	That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
	As his own state and ours, 'tis to be chid
	As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
	Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
	And so rebel to judgment.

</CÆSAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LEPIDUS>	<13%>
	Here's more news.
</LEPIDUS>

<MESSENGER>	<13%>
	Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,
	Most noble Cæsar, shalt thou have report
	How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
	And it appears he is belov'd of those
	That only have fear'd Cæsar; to the ports
	The discontents repair, and men's reports
	Give him much wrong'd.
</MESSENGER>

<CÆSAR>	<13%>
	I should have known no less.
	It hath been taught us from the primal state,
	That he which is was wish'd until he were;
	And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
	Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
	Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
	Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
	To rot itself with motion.
</CÆSAR>

<MESSENGER>	<13%>
	Cæsar, I bring thee word,
	Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
	Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
	With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
	They make in Italy; the borders maritime
	Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt;
	No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
	Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
	Than could his war resisted.
</MESSENGER>

<CÆSAR>	<13%>
	Antony,
	Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
	Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
	Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
	Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against,
	Though daintily brought up, with patience more
	Than savages could suffer; thou didst drink
	The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
	Which beasts would cough at; thy palate then did deign
	The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
	Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
	The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
	It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
	Which some did die to look on; and all this—
	It wounds thy honour that I speak it now—
	Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
	So much as lank'd not.
</CÆSAR>

<LEPIDUS>	<14%>
	'Tis pity of him.
</LEPIDUS>

<CÆSAR>	<14%>
	Let his shames quickly
	Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
	Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end
	Assemble me immediate council; Pompey
	Thrives in our idleness.
</CÆSAR>

<LEPIDUS>	<14%>
	To-morrow, Cæsar,
	I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
	Both what by sea and land I can be able
	To front this present time.
</LEPIDUS>

<CÆSAR>	<14%>
	Till which encounter,
	It is my business too. Farewell.
</CÆSAR>

<LEPIDUS>	<14%>
	Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
	Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
	To let me be partaker.
</LEPIDUS>

<CÆSAR>	<14%>
	Doubt not, sir;
	I knew it for my bond.

<Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Mardian.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CLEOPATRA>	<14%>
	Charmian!
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<14%>
	Madam!
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<14%>
	Ha, ha!
	Give me to drink mandragora.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<14%>
	Why, madam?
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<14%>
	That I might sleep out this great gap of time
	My Antony is away.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<14%>
	You think of him too much.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<14%>
	O! 'tis treason.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<14%>
	Madam, I trust, not so.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<14%>
	Thou, eunuch Mardian!
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARDIAN>	<14%>
	What 's your highness' pleasure?
</MARDIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<15%>
	Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
	In aught a eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee,
	That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
	May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARDIAN>	<15%>
	Yes, gracious madam.
</MARDIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<15%>
	Indeed!
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARDIAN>	<15%>
	Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
	But what in deed is honest to be done;
	Yet have I fierce affections, and think
	What Venus did with Mars.
</MARDIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<15%>
	O Charmian!
	Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
	Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
	O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
	Do bravely, horse, for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
	The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
	And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
	Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
	For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
	With most delicious poison. Think on me,
	That am with Phœbus' amorous pinches black,
	And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Cæsar,
	When thou wast here above the ground I was
	A morsel for a monarch, and great Pompey
	Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
	There would he anchor his aspect and die
	With looking on his life.

</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Alexas.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ALEXAS>	<15%>
	Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
</ALEXAS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<15%>
	How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
	Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
	With his tinct gilded thee.
	How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
</CLEOPATRA>

<ALEXAS>	<15%>
	Last thing he did, dear queen,
	He kiss'd, the last of many doubled kisses,
	This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
</ALEXAS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<15%>
	Mine ear must pluck it thence.
</CLEOPATRA>

<ALEXAS>	<15%>
	'Good friend,' quoth he,
	'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
	This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
	To mend the petty present, I will piece
	Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
	Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
	And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
	Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
	Was beastly dumb'd by him.
</ALEXAS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
	What! was he sad or merry?
</CLEOPATRA>

<ALEXAS>	<16%>
	Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
	Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.
</ALEXAS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
	O well-divided disposition! Note him,
	Note him, good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
	He was not sad, for he would shire on those
	That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
	Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
	In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
	O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
	The violence of either thee becomes,
	So does it no man else. Mett'st thou my posts?
</CLEOPATRA>

<ALEXAS>	<16%>
	Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
	Why do you send so thick?
</ALEXAS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
	Who's born that day
	When I forget to send to Antony,
	Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
	Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
	Ever love Cæsar so?
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<16%>
	O! that brave Cæsar.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
	Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
	Say the brave Antony.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<16%>
	The valiant Cæsar!
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
	By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
	If thou with Cæsar paragon again
	My man of men.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<16%>
	By your most gracious pardon,
	I sing but after you.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
	My salad days,
	When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
	To say as I said then! But come, away;
	Get me ink and paper:
	He shall have every day a several greeting,
	Or I'll unpeople Egypt.

<ACT 2>


<SCENE 1>
<Messina. A Room in Pompey's House.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas.>
</STAGE DIR>
<POMPEIUS>	<17%>
	If the great gods be just, they shall assist
	The deeds of justest men.
</POMPEIUS>

<MENECRATES>	<17%>
	Know, worthy Pompey,
	That what they do delay, they not deny.
</MENECRATES>

<POMPEIUS>	<17%>
	Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
	The thing we sue for.
</POMPEIUS>

<MENECRATES>	<17%>
	We, ignorant of ourselves,
	Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
	Deny us for our good; so find we profit
	By losing of our prayers.
</MENECRATES>

<POMPEIUS>	<17%>
	I shall do well:
	The people love me, and the sea is mine;
	My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
	Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
	In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
	No wars without doors; Cæsar gets money where
	He loses hearts; Lepidus flatters both,
	Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
	Nor either cares for him.
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<17%>
	Cæsar and Lepidus
	Are in the field; a mighty strength they carry.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<17%>
	Where have you this? 'tis false.
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<17%>
	From Silvius, sir.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<17%>
	He dreams; I know they are in Rome together,
	Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
	Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
	Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
	Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
	Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks
	Sharpen with cloyless sance his appetite,
	That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
	Even till a Lethe'd dulness!

</POMPEIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Varrius.>
</STAGE DIR>
	How now, Varrius!
<VARRIUS>	<18%>
	This is most certain that I shall deliver:
	Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
	Expected; since he went from Egypt 'tis
	A space for further travel.
</VARRIUS>

<POMPEIUS>	<18%>
	I could have given less matter
	A better ear. Menas, I did not think
	This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
	For such a petty war; his soldiership
	Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
	The higher our opinion, that our stirring
	Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
	The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<18%>
	I cannot hope
	Cæsar and Antony shall well greet together;
	His wife that's dead did trespasses to Cæsar,
	His brother warr'd upon him, although I think
	Not mov'd by Antony.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<18%>
	I know not, Menas,
	How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
	Were 't not that we stand up against them all
	'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves,
	For they have entertained cause enough
	To draw their swords; but how the fear of us
	May cement their divisions and bind up
	The petty difference, we yet not know.
	Be it as our gods will have 't! It only stands
	Our lives upon, to use our strongest hands.
	Come, Menas.

<Rome. A Room in Lepidus' House.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Enobarbus and Lepidus.>
</STAGE DIR>
<LEPIDUS>	<18%>
	Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
	And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
	To soft and gentle speech.
</LEPIDUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<18%>
	I shall entreat him
	To answer like himself: if Cæsar move him,
	Let Antony look over Cæsar's head,
	And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
	Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
	I would not shave 't to-day.
</ENOBARBUS>

<LEPIDUS>	<19%>
	'Tis not a time
	For private stomaching.
</LEPIDUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<19%>
	Every time
	Serves for the matter that is then born in 't.
</ENOBARBUS>

<LEPIDUS>	<19%>
	But small to greater matters must give way.
</LEPIDUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<19%>
	Not if the small come first.
</ENOBARBUS>

<LEPIDUS>	<19%>
	Your speech is passion;
	But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
	The noble Antony.

</LEPIDUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Antony and Ventidius.>
</STAGE DIR>
<ENOBARBUS>	<19%>
	And yonder, Cæsar.

</ENOBARBUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cæsar, Mecænas, and Agrippa.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
	If we compose well here, to Parthia:
	Hark ye, Ventidius.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<19%>
	I do not know,
	Mecænas; ask Agrippa.
</CÆSAR>

<LEPIDUS>	<19%>
	Noble friends,
	That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
	A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
	May it be gently heard; when we debate
	Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
	Murder in healing wounds; then, noble partners,—
	The rather for I earnestly beseech,—
	Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
	Nor curstness grow to the matter.
</LEPIDUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
	'Tis spoken well.
	Were we before our armies, and to fight,
	I should do thus.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<19%>
	Welcome to Rome.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
	Thank you.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<19%>
	Sit.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
	Sit, sir.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<19%>
	Nay, then.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
	I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
	Or being, concern you not.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<19%>
	I must be laugh'd at
	If, or for nothing or a little, I
	Should say myself offended, and with you
	Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should
	Once name you derogately, when to sound your name
	It not concern'd me.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<19%>
	My being in Egypt, Cæsar,
	What was 't to you?
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<19%>
	No more than my residing here at Rome
	Might be to you in Egypt; yet, if you there
	Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
	Might be my question.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<20%>
	How intend you, practis'd?
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<20%>
	You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
	By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
	Made wars upon me, and their contestation
	Was theme for you, you were the word of war.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<20%>
	You do mistake your business; my brother never
	Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
	And have my learning from some true reports,
	That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
	Discredit my authority with yours,
	And make the wars alike against my stomach,
	Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
	Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
	As matter whole you n' have to make it with,
	It must not be with this.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<20%>
	You praise yourself
	By laying defects of judgment to me, but
	You patch'd up your excuses.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<20%>
	Not so, not so;
	I know you could not lack, I am certain on 't,
	Very necessity of this thought, that I,
	Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
	Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
	Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
	I would you had her spirit in such another:
	The third o' the world is yours, which with a snaffle
	You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<20%>
	Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women!
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<20%>
	So much uncurbable, her garboils, Cæsar,
	Made out of her impatience,—which not wanted
	Shrewdness of policy too,—I grieving grant
	Did you too much disquiet; for that you must
	But say I could not help it.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<21%>
	I wrote to you
	When rioting in Alexandria; you
	Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
	Did gibe my missive out of audience.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<21%>
	Sir,
	He fell upon me, ere admitted: then
	Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
	Of what I was i' the morning; but next day
	I told him of myself, which was as much
	As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
	Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
	Out of our question wipe him.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<21%>
	You have broken
	The article of your oath, which you shall never
	Have tongue to charge me with.
</CÆSAR>

<LEPIDUS>	<21%>
	Soft, Cæsar!
</LEPIDUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<21%>
	No,
	Lepidus, let him speak:
	The honour's sacred which he talks on now,
	Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Cæsar;
	The article of my oath.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<21%>
	To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
	The which you both denied.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<21%>
	Neglected, rather;
	And then, when poison'd hours had bound me up
	From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
	I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
	Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
	Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
	To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
	For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
	So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
	To stoop in such a case.
</MARK ANTONY>

<LEPIDUS>	<21%>
	'Tis noble spoken.
</LEPIDUS>

<MECÆNAS>	<21%>
	If it might please you, to enforce no further
	The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
	Were to remember that the present need
	Speaks to atone you.
</MECÆNAS>

<LEPIDUS>	<21%>
	Worthily spoken, Mecænas.
</LEPIDUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<21%>
	Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<22%>
	Thou art a soldier only; speak no more.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<22%>
	That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<22%>
	You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<22%>
	Go to, then; your considerate stone.
</ENOBARBUS>

<CÆSAR>	<22%>
	I do not much dislike the matter, but
	The manner of his speech; for it cannot be
	We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
	So differing in their acts. Yet, if I knew
	What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
	O' the world I would pursue it.
</CÆSAR>

<AGRIPPA>	<22%>
	Give me leave, Cæsar.
</AGRIPPA>

<CÆSAR>	<22%>
	Speak, Agrippa.
</CÆSAR>

<AGRIPPA>	<22%>
	Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
	Admir'd Octavia; great Mark Antony
	Is now a widower.
</AGRIPPA>

<CÆSAR>	<22%>
	Say not so, Agrippa:
	If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
	Were well deserv'd of rashness.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<22%>
	I am not married, Cæsar; let me hear
	Agrippa further speak.
</MARK ANTONY>

<AGRIPPA>	<22%>
	To hold you in perpetual amity,
	To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
	With an unslipping knot, take Antony
	Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
	No worse a husband than the best of men,
	Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
	That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
	All little jealousies which now seem great,
	And all great fears which now import their dangers,
	Would then be nothing; truths would be but tales
	Where now half tales be truths; her love to both
	Would each to other and all loves to both
	Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,
	For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
	By duty ruminated.
</AGRIPPA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<22%>
	Will Cæsar speak?
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<22%>
	Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
	With what is spoke already.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
	What power is in Agrippa,
	If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
	To make this good?
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<23%>
	The power of Cæsar, and
	His power unto Octavia.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
	May I never
	To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
	Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand;
	Further this act of grace, and from this hour
	The heart of brothers govern in our loves
	And sway our great designs!
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<23%>
	There is my hand.
	A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
	Did ever love so dearly; let her live
	To join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never
	Fly off our loves again!
</CÆSAR>

<LEPIDUS>	<23%>
	Happily, amen!
</LEPIDUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
	I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey,
	For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
	Of late upon me; I must thank him only,
	Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
	At heel of that, defy him.
</MARK ANTONY>

<LEPIDUS>	<23%>
	Time calls upon 's:
	Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
	Or else he seeks out us.
</LEPIDUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
	Where lies he?
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<23%>
	About the Mount Misenum.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
	What's his strength
	By land?
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<23%>
	Great and increasing; but by sea
	He is an absolute master.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
	So is the fame.
	Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it;
	Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
	The business we have talk'd of.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<23%>
	With most gladness;
	And do invite you to my sister's view,
	Whither straight I'll lead you.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<23%>
	Let us, Lepidus,
	Not lack your company.
</MARK ANTONY>

<LEPIDUS>	<23%>
	Noble Antony,
	Not sickness should detain me.
</LEPIDUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Flourish. Exeunt Cæsar, Antony, and Lepidus.>
</STAGE DIR>

<MECÆNAS>	<23%>
	Welcome from Egypt, sir.
</MECÆNAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<23%>
	Half the heart of Cæsar, worthy Mecænas! My honourable friend, Agrippa!
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<24%>
	Good Enobarbus!
</AGRIPPA>

<MECÆNAS>	<24%>
	We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed well by 't in
	Egypt.
</MECÆNAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and made the night light with drinking.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MECÆNAS>	<24%>
	Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there; is this true?
</MECÆNAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	This was but as a fly by an eagle; we had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MECÆNAS>	<24%>
	She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
</MECÆNAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<24%>
	There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	I will tell you.
	The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
	Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold,
	Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that
	The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,
	Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
	The water which they beat to follow faster,
	As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
	It beggar'd all description; she did lie
	In her pavilion,—cloth-of-gold of tissue,—
	O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
	The fancy outwork nature; on each side her
	Stood pretty-dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
	With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
	To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
	And what they undid did.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<24%>
	O! rare for Antony.
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
	So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
	And made their bends adornings; at the helm
	A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackle
	Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
	That yarely frame the office. From the barge
	A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
	Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
	Her people out upon her, and Antony,
	Enthron'd i' the market-place, did sit alone,
	Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
	Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
	And made a gap in nature.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<25%>
	Rare Egyptian!
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<25%>
	Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
	Invited her to supper; she replied
	It should be better he became her guest,
	Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
	Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
	Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
	And, for his ordinary pays his heart
	For what his eyes eat only.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<25%>
	Royal wench!
	She made great Cæsar lay his sword to bed;
	He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<25%>
	I saw her once
	Hop forty paces through the public street;
	And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted
	That she did make defect perfection,
	And, breathless, power breathe forth.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MECÆNAS>	<25%>
	Now Antony must leave her utterly.
</MECÆNAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<25%>
	Never; he will not:
	Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
	Her infinite variety; other women cloy
	The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
	Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
	Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
	Bless her when she is riggish.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MECÆNAS>	<25%>
	If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
	The heart of Antony, Octavia is
	A blessed lottery to him.
</MECÆNAS>

<AGRIPPA>	<25%>
	Let us go.
	Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
	Whilst you abide here.
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<26%>
	Humbly, sir, I thank you.

<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
	The world and my great office will sometimes

<OCTAVIA>	<26%>
	All which time

</OCTAVIA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
	Good night, sir. My Octavia,
	Read not my blemishes in the world's report;
	I have not kept my square, but that to come

</CÆSAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Soothsayer.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
	Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?
</MARK ANTONY>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<26%>
	Would I had never come from thence, nor you
	Thither!
</SOOTHSAYER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
	If you can, your reason?
</MARK ANTONY>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<26%>
	I see it in
	My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
	Hie you to Egypt again.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
	Say to me,
	Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Cæsar's or mine?
</MARK ANTONY>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<26%>
	Cæsar's.
	Therefore, O Antony! stay not by his side;
	Thy demon—that's thy spirit which keeps thee,—is
	Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
	Where Cæsar's is not; but near him thy angel
	Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd; therefore
	Make space enough between you.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<26%>
	Speak this no more.
</MARK ANTONY>

<SOOTHSAYER>	<26%>
	To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
	If thou dost play with him at any game
	Thou art sure to lose, and, of that natural luck,
	He beats thee 'gainst the odds; thy lustre thickens
	When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
	Is all afraid to govern thee near him,
	But he away, 'tis noble.
</SOOTHSAYER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<27%>
	Get thee gone:
	Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Soothsayer.>
</STAGE DIR>
	He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap
	He hath spoken true; the very dice obey him.
	And in our sports my better cunning faints
	Under his chance; if we draw lots he speeds,
	His cocks do win the battle still of mine
	When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
	Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
	And though I make this marriage for my peace,
	I' the east my pleasure lies.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Ventidius.>

	O! come, Ventidius,

<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Mardian.>

<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
	Let it alone; let 's to billiards: come, Charmian.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<28%>
	My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
	As well a woman with a eunuch play'd
	As with a woman. Come, you 'll play with me, sir?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARDIAN>	<28%>
	As well as I can, madam.
</MARDIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
	And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
	The actor may plead pardon. I 'll none now.
	Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there—
	My music playing far off—I will betray
	Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
	Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
	I'll think them every one an Antony,
	And say, 'Ah, ha!' you're caught.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<28%>
	'Twas merry when
	You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
	Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
	With fervency drew up.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
	That time—O times!—
	I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
	I laugh'd him into patience: and next morn,
	Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
	Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
	I wore his sword Philippan.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O! from Italy;
	Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
</CLEOPATRA>
	That long time have been barren.
<MESSENGER>	<28%>
	Madam, madam,—
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
	Antony's dead! if thou say so, villain,
	Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,
	If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
	My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
	Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<28%>
	First, madam, he is well.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<28%>
	Why, there's more gold.
	But, sirrah, mark, we use
	To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
	The gold I give thee will I melt, and pour
	Down thy ill-uttering throat.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	Good madam, hear me.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
	Well, go to, I will;
	But there's no goodness in thy face; if Antony
	Be free and healthful, so tart a favour
	To trumpet such good tidings! if not well,
	Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
	Not like a formal man.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	Will't please you hear me?
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
	I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
	Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,
	Or friends with Cæsar, or not captive to him,
	I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
	Rich pearls upon thee.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	Madam, he's well.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
	Well said.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	And friends with Cæsar.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
	Thou'rt an honest man.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	Cæsar and he are greater friends than ever.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
	Make thee a fortune from me.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	But yet, madam,—
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
	I do not like 'but yet,' it does allay
	The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet!'
	'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
	Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
	Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
	The good and bad together. He's friends with Cæsar;
	In state of health, thou sayst; and thou sayst, free.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
	He's bound unto Octavia.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
	For what good turn?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	For the best turn i' the bed.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
	I am pale, Charmian!
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	Madam, he's married to Octavia.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<29%>
	The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Strikes him down.>
</STAGE DIR>

<MESSENGER>	<30%>
	Good madam, patience.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<30%>
	What say you? Hence,
<STAGE DIR>
<Strikes him again.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
	Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
<STAGE DIR>
<She hales him up and down.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
	Smarting in lingering pickle.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<30%>
	Gracious madam,
	I, that do bring the news made not the match.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<30%>
	Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
	And make thy fortunes proud; the blow thou hadst
	Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage,
	And I will boot thee with what gift beside
	Thy modesty can beg.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<30%>
	He's married, madam.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<30%>
	Rogue! thou hast liv'd too long.
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Draws a knife.>
</STAGE DIR>

<MESSENGER>	<30%>
	Nay, then I'll run.
	What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
</MESSENGER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<CHARMIAN>	<30%>
	Good madam, keep yourself within yourself;
	The man is innocent.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<30%>
	Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
	Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
	Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
	Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<30%>
	He is afeard to come.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<30%>
	I will not hurt him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Charmian.>
</STAGE DIR>
	These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
	A meaner than myself; since I myself
	Have given myself the cause.

<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Charmian, and Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Come hither, sir.
	Though it be honest, it is never good
	To bring bad news; give to a gracious message
	A host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell
</CLEOPATRA>
	Themselves when they be felt.
<MESSENGER>	<31%>
	I have done my duty.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
	Is he married?
	I cannot hate thee worser than I do
	If thou again say 'Yes.'
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<31%>
	He's married, madam.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
	The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<31%>
	Should I lie, madam?
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
	O! I would thou didst,
	So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
	A cistern for scal'd snakes. Go, get thee hence;
	Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
	Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<31%>
	I crave your highness' pardon.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
	He is married?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<31%>
	Take no offence that I would not offend you;
	To punish me for what you make me do
	Seems much unequal; he's married to Octavia.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
	O! that his fault should make a knave of thee,
	That art not what thou'rt sure of. Get thee hence;
	The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
	Are all too dear for me; lie they upon thy hand
	And be undone by 'em!
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Messenger.>
</STAGE DIR>

<CHARMIAN>	<31%>
	Good your highness, patience.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
	In praising Antony I have disprais'd Cæsar.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<31%>
	Many times, madam.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<31%>
	I am paid for 't now.
	Lead me from hence;
	I faint. O Iras! Charmian! 'Tis no matter.
	Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
	Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
	Her inclination, let him not leave out
	The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Alexas.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Let him forever go:—let him not—Charmian!—
	Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
	The other way's a Mars. <STAGE DIR>
<To Mardian.>
</STAGE DIR> Bid you Alexas
	Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
	But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.

	Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
	And we shall talk before we fight.
</POMPEIUS>

<CÆSAR>	<32%>
	Most meet
	That first we come to words, and therefore have we
	Our written purposes before us sent;
	Which if thou hast consider'd, let us know
	If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
	And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
	That else must perish here.
</CÆSAR>

<POMPEIUS>	<32%>
	To you all three,
	The senators alone of this great world,
	Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
	Wherefore my father should revengers want,
	Having a son and friends; since Julius Cæsar,
	Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
	There saw you labouring for him. What was 't
	That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what
	Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
	With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
	To drench the Capitol, but that they would
	Have one man but a man? And that is it
	Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
	The anger'd ocean foams, with which I meant
	To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
	Cast on my noble father.
</POMPEIUS>

<CÆSAR>	<32%>
	Take your time.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<32%>
	Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
	We 'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
	How much we do o'er-count thee.
</MARK ANTONY>

<POMPEIUS>	<32%>
	At land, indeed,
	Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house;
	But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
	Remain in 't as thou mayst.
</POMPEIUS>

<LEPIDUS>	<33%>
	Be pleas'd to tell us—
	For this is from the present—how you take

</LEPIDUS>

<CÆSAR>	<33%>
	There's the point.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<33%>
	Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
	What it is worth embrac'd.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<33%>
	And what may follow,
	To try a larger fortune.
</CÆSAR>

<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
	You have made me offer
	Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
	Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
	Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,
	To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
	Our targets undinted.
</POMPEIUS>

<CÆSAR>	<33%>
	That's our offer.

	That's our offer.

<LEPIDUS>	<33%>
	That's our offer.
</LEPIDUS>

<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
	Know, then,
	I came before you here a man prepar'd
	To take this offer; but Mark Antony
	Put me to some impatience. Though I lose
	The praise of it by telling, you must know,
	When Cæsar and your brother were at blows,
	Your mother came to Sicily and did find
	Her welcome friendly.
</POMPEIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<33%>
	I have heard it, Pompey;
	And am well studied for a liberal thanks
	Which I do owe you.
</MARK ANTONY>

<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
	Let me have your hand:
	I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
</POMPEIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<33%>
	The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
	That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither,
	For I have gain'd by 't.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<33%>
	Since I saw you last,
	There is a change upon you.
</CÆSAR>

<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
	Well, I know not
	What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face,
	But in my bosom shall she never come
	To make my heart her vassal.
</POMPEIUS>

<LEPIDUS>	<33%>
	Well met here.
</LEPIDUS>

<POMPEIUS>	<33%>
	I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
	I crave our composition may be written
	And seal'd between us.
</POMPEIUS>

<CÆSAR>	<34%>
	That 's the next to do.
</CÆSAR>

<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
	We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
	Draw lots who shall begin.
</POMPEIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<34%>
	That will I, Pompey.
</MARK ANTONY>

<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
	No, Antony, take the lot:
	But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
	Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Cæsar
	Grew fat with feasting there.
</POMPEIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<34%>
	You have heard much.
</MARK ANTONY>

<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
	I have fair meanings, sir.
</POMPEIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<34%>
	And fair words to them.
</MARK ANTONY>

<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
	Then, so much have I heard;
	And I have heard Apollodorus carried—
</POMPEIUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
	No more of that: he did so.
</ENOBARBUS>

<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
	What, I pray you?
</POMPEIUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
	A certain queen to Cæsar in a mattress.
</ENOBARBUS>

<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
	I know thee now; how far'st thou, soldier?
</POMPEIUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
	Well;
	And well am like to do; for I perceive
	Four feasts are toward.
</ENOBARBUS>

<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
	Let me shake thy hand;
	I never hated thee. I have seen thee fight,
	When I have envied thy behaviour.
</POMPEIUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
	Sir,
	I never lov'd you much, but I ha' prais'd ye
	When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
	As I have said you did.
</ENOBARBUS>

<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
	Enjoy thy plainness,
	It nothing ill becomes thee.
	Aboard my galley I invite you all:
	Will you lead, lords?
</POMPEIUS>

<CÆSAR>	<34%>
	Show us the way, sir.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<34%>
	Show us the way, sir.
</MARK ANTONY>

<LEPIDUS>	<34%>
	Show us the way, sir.
</LEPIDUS>

<POMPEIUS>	<34%>
	Come.
</POMPEIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt all except Menas and Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>

<MENAS>	<34%>
	Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this treaty. You and I have known, sir.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
	At sea, I think.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<34%>
	We have, sir.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
	You have done well by water.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<34%>
	And you by land.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
	I will praise any man that will praise me; though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	Nor what I have done by water.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	Yes, something you can deny for your own safety; you have been a great thief by sea.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	And you by land.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	All men's faces are true, whatsoe'er their hands are.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	No slander; they steal hearts.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	We came hither to fight with you.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	If he do, sure, he cannot weep it back again.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	You have said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	Cæsar's sister is called Octavia.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	Pray ye, sir?
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	'Tis true.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	Then is Cæsar and he for ever knit together.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	I think so too; but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<35%>
	Who would not have his wife so?
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again; then, shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Cæsar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<36%>
	And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<36%>
	I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<36%>
	Come; let 's away.
</MENAS>

<SCENE 7>
<On board Pompey's Galley off Misenum.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Music. Enter two or three Servants, with a banquet.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SERVANT 1>	<36%>
	Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already; the least wind i' the world will blow them down.
</SERVANT 1>

<SERVANT 2>	<36%>
	Lepidus is high-coloured.
</SERVANT 2>

<SERVANT 1>	<36%>
	They have made him drink alms-drink.
</SERVANT 1>

<SERVANT 2>	<36%>
	As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out, 'No more;' reconciles them to his entreaty, and himself to the drink.
</SERVANT 2>

<SERVANT 1>	<36%>
	But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.
</SERVANT 1>

<SERVANT 2>	<36%>
	Why, this it is to have a name in great men's fellowship; I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
</SERVANT 2>

<SERVANT 1>	<36%>
	To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.

</SERVANT 1>
<STAGE DIR>
<A sennet sounded. Enter Cæsar, Antony, Lepidus, Pompey,...>
<... Agrippa, Mecænas, Enobarbus, Menas, with other Captains.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<36%>
	Thus do they, sir. They take the flow o' the Nile
	By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know
	By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
	Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells
	The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
	Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
	And shortly comes to harvest.
</MARK ANTONY>

<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	You've strange serpents there.
</LEPIDUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
	Ay, Lepidus.
</MARK ANTONY>

<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.
</LEPIDUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
	They are so.
</MARK ANTONY>

<POMPEIUS>	<37%>
	Sit,—and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
</POMPEIUS>

<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
</LEPIDUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<37%>
	Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.
</ENOBARBUS>

<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things; without contradiction, I have heard that.
</LEPIDUS>

<MENAS>	<37%>
	Pompey, a word.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<37%>
	Say in mine ear; what is't?
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<37%>
	Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain,
	And bear me speak a word.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<37%>
	Forbear me till anon.
	This wine for Lepidus!
</POMPEIUS>

<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
</LEPIDUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
	It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own organs; it lives by that which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates.
</MARK ANTONY>

<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	What colour is it of?
</LEPIDUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
	Of it own colour too.
</MARK ANTONY>

<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	'Tis a strange serpent.
</LEPIDUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
	'Tis so; and the tears of it are wet.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<37%>
	Will this description satisfy him?
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<37%>
	With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very epicure.
</MARK ANTONY>

<POMPEIUS>	<37%>
	Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that? away!
	Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<38%>
	If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me,
	Rise from thy stool.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
	I think thou'rt mad. The matter?
</POMPEIUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Walks aside.>
</STAGE DIR>

<MENAS>	<38%>
	I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
	Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What 's else to say?
	Be jolly, lords.
</POMPEIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<38%>
	These quick-sands, Lepidus,
	Keep off them, for you sink.
</MARK ANTONY>

<MENAS>	<38%>
	Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
	What sayst thou?
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<38%>
	Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That 's twice.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
	How should that be?
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<38%>
	But entertain it,
	And though thou think me poor, I am the man
	Will give thee all the world.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
	Hast thou drunk well?
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<38%>
	No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
	Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove:
	Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
	Is thine, if thou wilt ha 't.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
	Show me which way.
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<38%>
	These three world-sharers, these competitors,
	Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
	And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
	All there is thine.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<38%>
	Ah! this thou shouldst have done,
	And not have spoke on 't. In me 'tis villany;
	In thee 't had been good service. Thou must know
	'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
	Mine honour it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
	Hath so betray'd thine act; being done unknown,
	I should have found it afterwards well done,
	But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
</POMPEIUS>

<MENAS>	<38%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> For this,
	I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
	Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
	Shall never find it more.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<39%>
	This health to Lepidus!
</POMPEIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<39%>
	Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<39%>
	Here's to thee, Menas!
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<39%>
	Enobarbus, welcome!
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<39%>
	Fill till the cup be hid.

<ENOBARBUS>	<39%>
	There's a strong fellow, Menas.
</ENOBARBUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Pointing to the Attendant who carries off Lepidus.>

<MENAS>	<39%>
	Why?
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<39%>
	A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<39%>
	The third part then is drunk; would it were all,
	That it might go on wheels!
</MENAS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<39%>
	Drink thou; increase the reels.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MENAS>	<39%>
	Come.
</MENAS>

<POMPEIUS>	<39%>
	This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
</POMPEIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<39%>
	It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
	Here is to Cæsar!
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<39%>
	I could well forbear't.
	It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
	And it grows fouler.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<39%>
	Be a child o' the time.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<39%>
	Possess it, I'll make answer;

	Let 's ha 't, good soldier.
</POMPEIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<39%>
	Come, let 's all take hands,
	Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
	In soft and delicate Lethe.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<39%>
	All take hands.
	Make battery to our ears with the loud music;

	What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,

<ACT 3>


<SCENE 1>
<A Plain in Syria.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Ventidius, in triumph, with Silius and other...>
<... Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of Pacorus borne before him.>
</STAGE DIR>
<VENTIDIUS>	<40%>
	Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
	Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
	Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
	Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
	Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
</VENTIDIUS>

<SILIUS>	<41%>
	Noble Ventidius,
	Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
	The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
	Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
	The routed fly; so thy grand captain Antony
	Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
	Put garlands on thy head.
</SILIUS>

<VENTIDIUS>	<41%>
	O Silius, Silius!
	I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
	May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius,
	Better to leave undone than by our deed
	Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
	Cæsar and Antony have ever won
	More in their officer than person; Sossius,
	One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
	For quick accumulation of renown,
	Which he achiev'd by the minute, lost his favour.
	Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
	Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
	The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
	Than gain which darkens him.
	I could do more to do Antonius good,
	But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
	Should my performance perish.
</VENTIDIUS>

<SILIUS>	<41%>
	Thou hast, Ventidius, that
	Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
	Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?
</SILIUS>

<VENTIDIUS>	<41%>
	I'll humbly signify what in his name,
	That magical word of war, we have effected;
	How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
	The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
	We have jaded out o' the field.
</VENTIDIUS>

<SILIUS>	<41%>
	Where is he now?
</SILIUS>

<VENTIDIUS>	<41%>
	He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste
	The weight we must convey with 's will permit,
	We shall appear before him. On, there; pass along.

<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
	What! are the brothers parted?
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
	They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
	The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
	To part from Rome; Cæsar is sad; and Lepidus,
	Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
	With the green sickness.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
	'Tis a noble Lepidus.
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
	A very fine one. O! how he loves Cæsar.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
	Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
	Cæsar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
	What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
	Spake you of Cæsar? How! the non-pareil!
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
	O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
	Would you praise Cæsar, say, 'Cæsar,' go no further.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
	Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<42%>
	But he loves Cæsar best; yet he loves Antony.
	Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
	Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number; hoo!
	His love to Antony. But as for Cæsar,
	Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<42%>
	Both he loves.

<MARK ANTONY>	<42%>
	No further, sir.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<42%>
	You take from me a great part of myself;
	Use me well in't. Sister, prove such a wife
	As my thoughts make thee, and as my furthest band
	Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
	Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
	Betwixt us as the cement of our love
	To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
	The fortress of it; for better might we
	Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts
	This be not cherish'd.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<43%>
	Make me not offended
	In your distrust.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<43%>
	I have said.
</CÆSAR>

<MARK ANTONY>	<43%>
	You shall not find,
	Though you be therein curious, the least cause
	For what you seem to fear. So, the gods keep you,
	And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
	We will here part.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CÆSAR>	<43%>
	Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
	The elements be kind to thee, and make

	The April's in her eyes; it is love's spring,

<OCTAVIA>	<43%>
	Sir, look well to my husband's house; and—
</OCTAVIA>

<CÆSAR>	<43%>
	What,
	Octavia?
</CÆSAR>

<OCTAVIA>	<43%>
	I'll tell you in your ear.
</OCTAVIA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<43%>
	Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
	Her heart obey her tongue; the swan's downfeather,

	He were the worse for that were he a horse;
	So is he, being a man.
</ENOBARBUS>

<AGRIPPA>	<43%>
	Why, Enobarbus,
	When Antony found Julius Cæsar dead
	He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
	When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
</AGRIPPA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<43%>
	That year, indeed, he was troubled with a rheum;
	What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
	Believe 't, till I wept too.

<CÆSAR>	<44%>
	No, sweet Octavia,
	You shall hear from me still; the time shall not

	Come, sir, come;

	Come hither, sir.
<ALEXAS>	<44%>
	Good majesty,
	Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you

</ALEXAS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
	That Herod's head
	I'll have; but how, when Antony is gone
	Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<44%>
	Most gracious majesty!
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
	Didst thou behold
	Octavia?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<44%>
	Ay, dread queen.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
	Where?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<44%>
	Madam, in Rome;
	I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
	Between her brother and Mark Antony.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
	Is she as tall as me?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<44%>
	She is not, madam.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
	Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongu'd, or low?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<44%>
	Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voic'd.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
	That's not so good. He cannot like her long.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<44%>
	Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<44%>
	I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
	What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
	If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<45%>
	She creeps;
	Her motion and her station are as one;
	She shows a body rather than a life,
	A statue than a breather.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
	Is this certain?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<45%>
	Or I have no observance.
</MESSENGER>

<CHARMIAN>	<45%>
	Three in Egypt
	Cannot make better note.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
	He's very knowing,
	I do perceive 't. There's nothing in her yet.
	The fellow has good judgment.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<45%>
	Excellent.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
	Guess at her years, I prithee.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<45%>
	Madam,
	She was a widow,—
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
	Widow! Charmian, hark.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<45%>
	And I do think she's thirty.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
	Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<45%>
	Round even to faultiness.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
	For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
	Her hair, what colour?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MESSENGER>	<45%>
	Brown, madam; and her forehead
	As low as she would wish it.
</MESSENGER>

<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
	There's gold for thee:
	Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
	I will employ thee back again; I find thee
	Most fit for business. Go, make thee ready;
	Our letters are prepar'd.

	This creature's no such thing.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<45%>
	Nothing, madam.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
	The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<45%>
	Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
	And serving you so long!
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<45%>
	I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
	But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
	Where I will write. All may be well enough.

<MARK ANTONY>	<46%>
	Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,
	That were excusable, that, and thousands more
	Of semblable import, but he hath wag'd
	New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
	To public ear:
	Spoke scantly of me; when perforce he could not
	But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
	He vented them; most narrow measure lent me;
	When the best hint was given him, he not took 't,
	Or did it from his teeth.
</MARK ANTONY>

<OCTAVIA>	<46%>
	O my good lord!
	Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
	Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
	If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
	Praying for both parts:
	The good gods will mock me presently,
	When I shall pray, 'O! bless my lord and husband;'
	Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
	'O! bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
	Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
	'Twixt these extremes at all.
</OCTAVIA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<46%>
	Gentle Octavia,
	Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
	Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour
	I lose myself; better I were not yours
	Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
	Yourself shall go between's; the mean time, lady,
	I'll raise the preparation of a war
	Shall stain your brother; make your soonest haste,
	So your desires are yours.
</MARK ANTONY>

<OCTAVIA>	<46%>
	Thanks to my lord.
	The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
	Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
	As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
	Should solder up the rift.
</OCTAVIA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<47%>
	When it appears to you where this begins,
	Turn your displeasure that way; for our faults
	Can never be so equal that your love
	Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
	Choose your own company, and command what cost
	Your heart has mind to.

	There's strange news come, sir.

<ENOBARBUS>	<47%>
	What, man?
</ENOBARBUS>

<EROS>	<47%>
	Cæsar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
</EROS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<47%>
	This is old: what is the success?
</ENOBARBUS>

<EROS>	<47%>
	Cæsar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
</EROS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<47%>
	Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
	And throw between them all the food thou hast,
	They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
</ENOBARBUS>

<EROS>	<47%>
	He's walking in the garden—thus: and spurns
	The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool, Lepidus!'
	And threats the throat of that his officer
	That murder'd Pompey.

	Our great navy's rigg'd.

<Enter Cæsar, Agrippa, and Mecænas.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CÆSAR>	<48%>
	Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
	In Alexandria; here's the manner of 't;
	I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
	Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
	Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat
	Cæsarion, whom they call my father's son,
	And all the unlawful issue that their lust
	Since then hath made between them. Unto her
	He gave the 'stablishment of Egypt; made her
	Of Lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
	Absolute queen.
</CÆSAR>

<MECÆNAS>	<48%>
	This in the public eye?
</MECÆNAS>

<CÆSAR>	<48%>
	I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
	His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings;
	Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia
	He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
	Syria, Cilicia, and Phœnicia. She
	In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
	That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
	As 'tis reported, so.
</CÆSAR>

<MECÆNAS>	<48%>
	Let Rome be thus
	Informed.
</MECÆNAS>

<AGRIPPA>	<48%>
	Who, queasy with his insolence
	Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
</AGRIPPA>

<CÆSAR>	<48%>
	The people know it; and have now receiv'd
	His accusations.
</CÆSAR>

<AGRIPPA>	<48%>
	Whom does he accuse?
</AGRIPPA>

<CÆSAR>	<48%>
	Cæsar; and that, having in Sicily
	Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
	His part o' the isle; then does he say, he lent me
	Some shipping unrestor'd; lastly, he frets
	That Lepidus of the triumvirate
	Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain
	All his revenue.
</CÆSAR>

<AGRIPPA>	<48%>
	Sir, this should be answer'd.
</AGRIPPA>

<CÆSAR>	<48%>
	'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
	I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
	That he his high authority abus'd,
	And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
	I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
	And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
	Demand the like.
</CÆSAR>

<MECÆNAS>	<49%>
	He'll never yield to that.
</MECÆNAS>

<CÆSAR>	<49%>
	Nor must not then be yielded to in this.

</CÆSAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Octavia, with her Train.>
</STAGE DIR>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	Hail, Cæsar, and my lord! hail, most dear Cæsar!
</OCTAVIA>

<CÆSAR>	<49%>
	That ever I should call thee cast-away!
</CÆSAR>

<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
</OCTAVIA>

<CÆSAR>	<49%>
	Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
	Like Cæsar's sister; the wife of Antony
	Should have an army for an usher, and
	The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
	Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
	Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
	Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
	Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
	Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
	A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
	The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
	Is often left unlov'd: we should have met you
	By sea and land, supplying every stage
	With an augmented greeting.
</CÆSAR>

<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	Good my lord,
	To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
	On my free-will. My lord, Mark Antony,
	Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
	My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
	His pardon for return.
</OCTAVIA>

<CÆSAR>	<49%>
	Which soon he granted,
	Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
</CÆSAR>

<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	Do not say so, my lord.
</OCTAVIA>

<CÆSAR>	<49%>
	I have eyes upon him,
	And his affairs come to me on the wind.
	Where is he now?
</CÆSAR>

<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	My lord, in Athens.
</OCTAVIA>

<CÆSAR>	<49%>
	No, my most wrong'd sister; Cleopatra
	Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
	Up to a whore; who now are levying
	The kings o' the earth for war. He hath assembled
	Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus,
	Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King
	Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
	King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
	Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King
	Of Comagene; Polemon and Amintas,
	The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
	With a more larger list of sceptres.
</CÆSAR>

<OCTAVIA>	<50%>
	Ay me, most wretched,
	That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
	That do afflict each other!
</OCTAVIA>

<CÆSAR>	<50%>
	Welcome hither:
	Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
	Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led
	And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
	Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
	O'er your content these strong necessities,
	But let determin'd things to destiny
	Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
	Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd
	Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
	To do you justice, make their ministers
	Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
	And ever welcome to us.
</CÆSAR>

<AGRIPPA>	<50%>
	Welcome, lady.
</AGRIPPA>

<MECÆNAS>	<50%>
	Welcome, dear madam.
	Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
	Only the adulterous Antony, most large
	In his abominations, turns you off,
	And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
	That noises it against us.
</MECÆNAS>

<OCTAVIA>	<50%>
	Is it so, sir?
</OCTAVIA>

<CÆSAR>	<50%>
	Most certain. Sister, welcome; pray you,

<ENOBARBUS>	<51%>

</ENOBARBUS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<51%>
	What is 't you say?
</CLEOPATRA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<51%>
	Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
	Take from his heart, take from his brain, from 's time,
	What should not then be spar'd. He is already
	Traduc'd for levity, and 'tis said in Rome
	That Photinus a eunuch and your maids
	Manage this war.
</ENOBARBUS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<51%>
	Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
	That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,

	Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;

</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<51%>
	Celerity is never more admir'd
	Than by the negligent.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<51%>
	A good rebuke,
	Which might have well becom'd the best of men,
	To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
	Will fight with him by sea.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<51%>
	By sea! What else?
</CLEOPATRA>

<CANIDIUS>	<51%>
	Why will my lord do so?
</CANIDIUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<51%>
	For that he dares us to 't.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<52%>
	So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
</ENOBARBUS>

<CANIDIUS>	<52%>
	Ay, and to wage his battle at Pharsalia,
	Where Cæsar fought with Pompey; but these offers,
	Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
	And so should you.
</CANIDIUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<52%>
	Your ships are not well mann'd;
	Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
	Ingross'd by swift impress; in Cæsar's fleet
	Are those that often have gainst Pompey fought:
	Their ships are yare; yours, heavy. No disgrace
	Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
	Being prepar'd for land.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<52%>
	By sea, by sea.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<52%>
	Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
	The absolute soldiership you have by land;
	Distract your army, which doth most consist
	Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
	Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
	The way which promises assurance; and
	Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
	From firm security.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<52%>
	I'll fight at sea.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<52%>
	I have sixty sails, Cæsar none better.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<52%>
	Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
	And with the rest, full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
	Beat the approaching Cæsar. But if we fail,
	We then can do 't at land.

</MARK ANTONY>

	Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
	Strange that his power should be. Canidius,

<SOLDIER>	<52%>
	O noble emperor! do not fight by sea;

	Be 't so. Declare thine office.

<EUPHRONIUS>	<58%>
	Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and

	Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,

	For Antony,

	Antony only, that would make his will

	The itch of his affection should not then
	Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,

	A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
	Do draw the inward quality after them,
	To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
	Knowing all measures, the full Cæsar will
	Answer his emptiness! Cæsar, thou hast subdu'd
	His judgment too.

</STAGE DIR>

<ENOBARBUS>	<60%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Mine honesty and I begin to square.
	The loyalty well held to fools does make
	Our faith mere folly; yet he that can endure
	To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord,
	Does conquer him that did his master conquer,

</CLEOPATRA>

<THYREUS>	<60%>
	So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
</THYREUS>

<ENOBARBUS>	<60%>
	He needs as many, sir, as Cæsar has,
	Or needs not us. If Cæsar please, our master
	Will leap to be his friend; for us, you know
	Whose he is we are, and that is Cæsar's.
</ENOBARBUS>

<THYREUS>	<60%>
	So.
	Thus then, thou most renown'd: Cæsar entreats,

	Go on; right royal.

<CLEOPATRA>	<60%>
	O!
</CLEOPATRA>

<THYREUS>	<60%>
	The scars upon your honour therefore he
	Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
	Not as deserv'd.

<CLEOPATRA>	<60%>

<ENOBARBUS>	<61%>
<STAGE DIR>

</STAGE DIR> To be sure of that,

<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<THYREUS>	<61%>
	Shall I say to Cæsar
	What you require of him? for he partly begs

	To hear from me you had left Antony,
	And put yourself under his shroud,

	Most kind messenger,
	Say to great Cæsar this: in deputation
	I kiss his conqu'ring hand; tell him, I am prompt
	To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel;
	Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear
	The doom of Egypt.
</CLEOPATRA>

<THYREUS>	<61%>
	'Tis your noblest course.
	Wisdom and fortune combating together,
	If that the former dare but what it can,
	No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay

<CLEOPATRA>	<61%>
	Your Cæsar's father oft,

<CLEOPATRA>	<62%>
	O! is't come to this?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<62%>
	I found you as a morsel, cold upon

	Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
	Luxuriously pick'd out; for, I am sure,
	Though you can guess what temperance should be,
	You know not what it is.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<63%>
	Wherefore is this?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<63%>
	To let a fellow that will take rewards
	And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
	My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
	And plighter of high hearts. O! that I were
	Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
	The horned herd; for I have savage cause;
	And to proclaim it civilly were like
	A halter'd neck, which does the hangman thank

	If that thy father live, let him repent

	The white hand of a lady fever thee,
	Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Cæsar,
	Tell him thy entertainment; look, thou say
	He makes me angry with him; for he seems
	Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
	Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
	And at this time most easy 'tis to do 't,
	When my good stars, that were my former guides,
	Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
	Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
	My speech and what is done, tell him he has
	Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom

	Dissolve my life. The next Cæsarion smite,
	Till by degrees the memory of my womb,

	Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
	If from the field I shall return once more

	That's my brave lord!
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<64%>
	I will betreble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
	And fight maliciously; for when mine hours
	Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
	Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
	And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
	Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
	All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
	Let's mock the midnight bell.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<64%>
	It is my birth-day:
	I had thought to have held it poor; but, since my lord
	Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<65%>
	We will yet do well.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<65%>
	Call all his noble captains to my lord.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<65%>
	Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
	The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
	There's sap in 't yet. The next time I do fight
	I'll make death love me, for I will contend
	Even with his pestilent scythe.
</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt all but Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR>

<ENOBARBUS>	<65%>
	Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
	Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
	The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
	A diminution in our captain's brain
	Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason
	It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
	Some way to leave him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>

<ACT 4>


<SCENE 1>
<Before Alexandria. Cæsar's Camp.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cæsar, reading a letter; Agrippa, Mecænas, and Others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<CÆSAR>	<65%>
	He calls me boy, and chides as he had power
	To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
	He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
	Cæsar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
	I have many other ways to die; meantime
	Laugh at his challenge.
</CÆSAR>

<MECÆNAS>	<65%>
	Cæsar must think,
	When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
	Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
	Make boot of his distraction: never anger
	Made good guard for itself.
</MECÆNAS>

<CÆSAR>	<65%>
	Let our best heads
	Know that to-morrow the last of many battles
	We mean to fight. Within our files there are,
	Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late,
	Enough to fetch him in. See it done;
	And feast the army; we have store to do 't,
	And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!
</CÆSAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>

<SCENE 2>
<Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Antony, Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras, Alexas, and Others.>
</STAGE DIR>
<MARK ANTONY>	<66%>
	He will not fight with me, Domitius.
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<66%>
	No.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<66%>
	Why should he not?
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<66%>
	He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
	He is twenty men to one.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<66%>
	To-morrow, soldier,
	By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
	Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
	Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<66%>
	I'll strike, and cry, 'Take all.'
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<66%>
	Well said; come on.
	Call forth my household servants; let's to-night
	Be bounteous at our meal.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter three or four Servitors.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Give me thy hand,
	Thou hast been rightly honest; so hast thou;
	Thou; and thou, and thou: you have serv'd me well,
</MARK ANTONY>
	And kings have been your fellows.
<CLEOPATRA>	<66%>
	What means this?
</CLEOPATRA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<66%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Cleopatra.>
</STAGE DIR> 'Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots
	Out of the mind.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<66%>
	And thou art honest too.
	I wish I could be made so many men,
	And all of you clapp'd up together in
	An Antony, that I might do you service
	So good as you have done.
</MARK ANTONY>

<SERVANTS>	<66%>
	The gods forbid!
</SERVANTS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<66%>
	Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night,
	Scant not my cups, and make as much of me
	As when mine empire was your fellow too,
	And suffer'd my command.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<66%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Enobarbus.>
</STAGE DIR> What does he mean?
</CLEOPATRA>

<ENOBARBUS>	<66%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Cleopatra.>
</STAGE DIR> To make his followers weep.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<67%>
	Tend me to-night;
	May be it is the period of your duty:
	Haply, you shall not see me more; or if,
	A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
	You'll serve another master. I look on you
	As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
	I turn you not away; but, like a master
	Married to your good service, stay till death.
	Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
	And the gods yield you for 't!
</MARK ANTONY>

<ENOBARBUS>	<67%>
	What mean you, sir,
	To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
	And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd: for shame,
	Transform us not to women.
</ENOBARBUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<67%>
	Ho, ho, ho!
	Now, the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
	Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
	You take me in too dolorous a sense,
	For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
	To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
	I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
	Where rather I'll expect victorious life
	Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
	And drown consideration.

</SOLDIER 2>

<SOLDIER 1>	<67%>
	Nothing. What news?

<SOLDIER 2>	<67%>

<SOLDIER 3>	<68%>
	And you. Good night, good night.

<The first two place themselves at their posts.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SOLDIER 4>	<68%>
	Here we:

<SOLDIER 1>	<68%>
	Peace, I say!
	What should this mean?
</SOLDIER 1>

<SOLDIER 2>	<68%>
	'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,

<MARK ANTONY>	<68%>
	No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Eros, with armour.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Come, good fellow, put mine iron on:
	If Fortune be not ours to-day, it is

</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<69%>
	Nay, I'll help too.
	What's this for?

<MARK ANTONY>	<69%>
	Ah! let be, let be; thou art

</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<69%>
	Sooth, la! I'll help: thus it must be.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<69%>
	Well, well;
	We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
	Go put on thy defences.
</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<69%>
	Briefly, sir.
</EROS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<69%>
	Is not this buckled well?
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<69%>
	Rarely, rarely:
	He that unbuckles this, till we do please
	To daff 't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
	Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
	More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love!
	That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
	The royal occupation, thou shouldst see
	A workman in 't.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter an armed Soldier.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Good morrow to thee; welcome;
	Thou look'st like him that knows a war-like charge:
	To business that we love we rise betime,
</MARK ANTONY>
	And go to 't with delight.
<SOLDIER>	<69%>
	A thousand, sir,

<MARK ANTONY>	<69%>
	'Tis well blown, lads.
	This morning, like the spirit of a youth
	That means to be of note, begins betimes.
	So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
	Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me;
	This is a soldier's kiss. <STAGE DIR>
<Kisses her.>
</STAGE DIR> Rebukeable

<MARK ANTONY>	<70%>
	Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd

</MARK ANTONY>

<SOLDIER>	<70%>
	Hadst thou done so,

	Follow'd thy heels.

	Who's gone this morning?
</MARK ANTONY>

<SOLDIER>	<70%>
	Who!
	One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
	He shall not hear thee; or from Cæsar's camp
	Say, 'I am none of thine.'
</SOLDIER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<70%>
	What sayst thou?
</MARK ANTONY>

<SOLDIER>	<70%>
	Sir,

	Sir, his chests and treasure
	He has not with him.

<MARK ANTONY>	<70%>
	Is he gone?
</MARK ANTONY>

<SOLDIER>	<70%>
	Most certain.
</SOLDIER>

<MARK ANTONY>	<70%>
	Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
	Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him—
	I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings;

	Cæsar, I shall.

<STAGE DIR>

	Upon himself.
</CÆSAR>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Cæsar and his Train.>
</STAGE DIR>

<ENOBARBUS>	<71%>
	Alexas did revolt, and went to Jewry on
	Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
	Great Herod to incline himself to Cæsar,
	And leave his master Antony: for this pains
	Cæsar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
	That fell away have entertainment, but
	No honourable trust. I have done ill,
	Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
	That I will joy no more.

</ENOBARBUS>
<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Soldier of Cæsar's.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SOLDIER>	<71%>
	Enobarbus, Antony
	Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with

	Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
	Unloading of his mules.
</SOLDIER>

<ENOBARBUS>	<71%>
	I give it you.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SOLDIER>	<71%>
	Mock not, Enobarbus.
	I tell you true: best you saf'd the bringer
	Out of the host; I must attend mine office
	Or would have done 't myself. Your emperor
	Continues still a Jove.
</SOLDIER>
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

<ENOBARBUS>	<72%>
	I am alone the villain of the earth,
	And feel I am so most. O Antony!
	Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
	My better service, when my turpitude
	Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
	If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
	Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do 't, I feel.
	I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
	Some ditch, wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
	My latter part of life.

<Alarum. Enter Antony, and Scarus wounded.>
</STAGE DIR>
<SCARUS>	<72%>
	O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
	Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
	With clouts about their heads.

<MARK ANTONY>	<72%>
	Thou bleed'st apace.
</MARK ANTONY>

<SCARUS>	<72%>
	I had a wound here that was like a T,

</SCARUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<72%>
	They do retire.

	They are beaten, sir; and our advantage serves
	For a fair victory.

	Let us score their backs,
	And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
	'Tis sport to maul a runner.
</SCARUS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<72%>
	I will reward thee
	Once for thy sprightly comfort, and ten-fold

<MARK ANTONY>	<73%>
	We have beat him to his camp; run one before
	And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
	Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
	That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;
	For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
	Not as you serv'd the cause, but as 't had been
	Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
	Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
	Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
	Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
	The honour'd gashes whole. <STAGE DIR>
<To Scarus.>
</STAGE DIR> Give me thy hand:

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Cleopatra, attended.>
</STAGE DIR>
	To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
	Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o' the world!
	Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,
	Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
</MARK ANTONY>
	Ride on the pants triumphing.
<CLEOPATRA>	<73%>
	Lord of lords!
	O infinite virtue! com'st thou smiling from
	The world's great snare uncaught?

<MARK ANTONY>	<73%>
	My nightingale,
	We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! though grey
	Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
	A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
	Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
	Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
	Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
	As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
	Destroy'd in such a shape.
</MARK ANTONY>

<CLEOPATRA>	<73%>
	I'll give thee, friend,
	An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
</CLEOPATRA>

<MARK ANTONY>	<74%>
	He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
	Like holy Phœbus' car. Give me thy hand:
	Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
	Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
	Had our great palace the capacity
	To camp this host, we all would sup together
	And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
	Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
	With brazen din blast you the city's ear,

	O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,

	For both, my lord.

<MARK ANTONY>	<75%>
	I would they'd fight i' the fire or i' the air;
	We'd fight there too. But this it is; our foot
	Upon the hills adjoining to the city
	Shall stay with us; order for sea is given,

<CÆSAR>	<75%>
	But being charg'd, we will be still by land,

	Swallows have built

	All is lost!
	This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me;

	Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
	Hast sold me to this novice, and my heart
	Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;

	O sun! thy uprise shall I see no more;

	That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
	Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
	On blossoming Cæsar; and this pine is bark'd,
	That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.
	O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,
	Whose eyes beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home,
	Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,
	Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
	Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.

	Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,

	Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot

	'Tis well thou'rt gone,

	The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
	Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
	Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
	And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
	Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:

	Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<78%>
	Ay, noble lord.
</EROS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<78%>
	Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
	A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
	A tower'd citadel, a pendant rock,
	A forked mountain, or blue promontory
	With trees upon 't, that nod unto the world
	And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen these signs;
	They are black vesper's pageants.
</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<78%>
	Ay, my lord.
</EROS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<78%>
	That which is now a horse, even with a thought
	The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
	As water is in water.
</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<78%>
	It does, my lord.
</EROS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<78%>
	My good knave, Eros, now thy captain is
	Even such a body: here I am Antony;
	Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
	I made these wars for Egypt; and the queen,
	Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
	Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto 't
	A million more, now lost; she, Eros, has
	Pack'd cards with Cæsar, and false-play'd my glory
	Unto an enemy's triumph.
	Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
	Ourselves to end ourselves.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Mardian.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O! thy vile lady;
</MARK ANTONY>
	She has robb'd me of my sword.
<MARDIAN>	<78%>
	No, Antony;
	My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
	With thine entirely.
</MARDIAN>

<MARK ANTONY>	<78%>
	Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
	She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
</MARK ANTONY>

<MARDIAN>	<78%>
	Death of one person can be paid but once,
	And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do
	Is done unto thy hand; the last she spake
	Was, 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
	Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
	The name of Antony; it was divided
	Between her heart and lips. She render'd life,
	Thy name so buried in her.
</MARDIAN>

<MARK ANTONY>	<79%>
	Dead, then?
</MARK ANTONY>

<MARDIAN>	<79%>
	Dead.
</MARDIAN>

<MARK ANTONY>	<79%>
	Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
	And we must sleep. <STAGE DIR>
<To Mardian.>
</STAGE DIR> That thou depart'st hence safe,
	Does pay thy labour richly; go.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Mardian.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Off, pluck off:
	The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
	The battery from my heart. O! cleave, my sides;
	Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
	Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
	No more a soldier; bruised pieces, go;
	You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Eros.>
</STAGE DIR>
	I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
	Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
	All length is torture; since the torch is out,
	Lie down, and stray no further. Now all labour
	Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
	Itself with strength; seal then, and all is done.
	Eros!—I come, my queen.—Eros!—Stay for me:
	Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
	And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze;
	Dido and her Æneas shall want troops,
	And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros! Eros!

</MARK ANTONY>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Eros.>
</STAGE DIR>
<EROS>	<79%>
	What would my lord?
</EROS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<79%>
	Since Cleopatra died,
	I have liv'd in such dishonour, that the gods
	Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
	Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
	With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
	The courage of a woman; less noble mind
	Than she, which by her death our Cæsar tells
	'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
	That, when the exigent should come,—which now
	Is come indeed,—when I should see behind me
	The inevitable prosecution of
	Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
	Thou then wouldst kill me: do 't; the time is come.
	Thou strik'st not me, 'tis Cæsar thou defeat'st.
	Put colour in thy cheek.
</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<80%>
	The gods withhold me!
	Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
	Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
</EROS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<80%>
	Eros,
	Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome, and see
	Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
	His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
	To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
	Of fortunate Cæsar, drawn before him, branded
	His baseness that ensu'd?
</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<80%>
	I would not see't.
</EROS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<80%>
	Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.
	Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
	Most useful for thy country.
</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<80%>
	O, sir! pardon me.
</EROS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<80%>
	When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
	To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
	Or thy precedent services are all
	But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.
</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<80%>
	Turn from me then that noble countenance,
	Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

<MARK ANTONY>	<80%>
	Lo thee!

<STAGE DIR>
<Turning from him.>

</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<80%>
	My dear master,
	My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
	Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
</EROS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<81%>
	'Tis said, man; and farewell.
</MARK ANTONY>

<EROS>	<81%>
	Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?

<MARK ANTONY>	<81%>
	Now, Eros.

	Why, there then; thus do I escape the sorrow
<STAGE DIR>
<Kills himself.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Of Antony's death.
</EROS>

<MARK ANTONY>	<81%>
	Thrice-nobler than myself!
	Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
	I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
	Have by their brave instruction got upon me
	A nobleness in record; but I will be
	A bridegroom in my death, and run into 't
	As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
	Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus

	Now, my lord.
</DIOMEDES>

<MARK ANTONY>	<82%>
	Where is she?
</MARK ANTONY>

<DIOMEDES>	<82%>
	Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
	Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw—
	Which never shall be found—you did suspect
	She had dispos'd with Cæsar, and that your rage
	Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead;
	But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
	Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
	I dread, too late.
</DIOMEDES>

<MARK ANTONY>	<82%>
	Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.

	Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate

	The miserable change now at my end

<DERCETAS>	<86%>
	I am call'd Dercetas;

<CÆSAR>	<86%>
	The breaking of so great a thing should make

	He is dead, Cæsar;
	Not by a public minister of justice,
	Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
	Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
	Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,

	O Antony!

	Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
	Have shown to thee such a declining day,
	Or look on thine; we could not stall together
	In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
	With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
	That thou, my brother, my competitor
	In top of all design, my mate in empire,
	Friend and companion in the front of war,
	The arm of mine own body, and the heart
	Where mine his thoughts did kindle, that our stars,
	Unreconciliable, should divide
	Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends,—

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter an Egyptian.>

	We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
<EGYPTIAN>	<87%>
	A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
	Confin'd in all she has, her monument,
	Of thy intents desires instruction,
	That she preparedly may frame herself
	To the way she's forc'd to.
</EGYPTIAN>

<CÆSAR>	<87%>
	Bid her have good heart;
	She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
	How honourable and how kindly we

<CLEOPATRA>	<88%>
	My desolation does begin to make
	A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Cæsar;
	Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
	A minister of her will; and it is great
	To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
	Which shackles accidents, and bolts up change,
	Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
	The beggar's nurse and Cæsar's.

<PROCULAEIUS>	<88%>
	My name is Proculeius.

<CLEOPATRA>	<88%>
	Antony
	Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
	I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
	That have no use for trusting. If your master
	Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
	That majesty, to keep decorum, must
	No less beg than a kingdom; if he please
	To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
	He gives me so much of mine own as I
	Will kneel to him with thanks.
</CLEOPATRA>

<PROCULAEIUS>	<88%>
	Be of good cheer;
	You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing.
	Make your full reference freely to my lord,
	Who is so full of grace, that it flows over
	On all that need; let me report to him
	Your sweet dependancy, and you shall find
	A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
	Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
</PROCULAEIUS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<89%>
	Pray you, tell him
	I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him

</PROCULAEIUS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<90%>
	Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
	If idle talk will once be necessary,
	I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,
	Do Cæsar what he can. Know, sir, that I
	Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
	Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
	Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
	And show me to the shouting varletry
	Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
	Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
	Lay me stark nak'd, and let the water-flies
	Blow me into abhorring! rather make
	My country's high pyramides my gibbet,

<DOLABELLA>	<90%>
	Assuredly you know me.
</DOLABELLA>

<CLEOPATRA>	<90%>
	No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
	You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
	Is 't not your trick?
</CLEOPATRA>

<DOLABELLA>	<90%>
	I understand not, madam.
</DOLABELLA>

<CLEOPATRA>	<90%>
	I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
	O! such another sleep, that I might see
	But such another man.
</CLEOPATRA>

<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
	If it might please ye,—
</DOLABELLA>

<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
	His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck
	A sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted
	The little O, the earth.
</CLEOPATRA>

<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
	Most sovereign creature,—
</DOLABELLA>

<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
	His legs besfrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
	Crested the world; his voice was propertied
	As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
	But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
	He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
	There was no winter in 't, an autumn 'twas
	That grew the more by reaping; his delights
	Were dolphin-like, they show'd his back above
	The element they liv'd in; in his livery
	Walk'd crowns and crownets, realms and islands were
	As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
</CLEOPATRA>

<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
	Cleopatra,—
</DOLABELLA>

<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
	Think you there was, or might be, such a man
	As this I dream'd of?
</CLEOPATRA>

<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
	Gentle madam, no.
</DOLABELLA>

<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
	You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
	But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
	It's past the size of dreaming; nature wants stuff
	To vie strange forms with fancy; yet to imagine
	An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
	Condemning shadows quite.
</CLEOPATRA>

<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
	Hear me, good madam.
	Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
	As answering to the weight: would I might never
	O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
	By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
	My very heart at root.
</DOLABELLA>

<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
	I thank you, sir.
	Know you what Cæsar means to do with me?
</CLEOPATRA>

<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
	I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
</DOLABELLA>

<CLEOPATRA>	<91%>
	Nay, pray you, sir,—

<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
	Though he be honourable,—
</DOLABELLA>

<CLEOPATRA>	<92%>
	Sole sir o' the world,

	Been laden with like frailties which before
	Have often sham'd our sex.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CÆSAR>	<92%>
	Cleopatra, know,
	We will extenuate rather than enforce:
	If you apply yourself to our intents,—
	Which towards you are most gentle,—you shall find
	A benefit in this change; but if you seek
	To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
	Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
	Of my good purposes, and put your children
	To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
	If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
</CÆSAR>

<CLEOPATRA>	<92%>
	And may through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,

<SELEUCUS>	<93%>
	Madam,

</SELEUCUS>

<CLEOPATRA>	<93%>
	What have I kept back?
</CLEOPATRA>

<SELEUCUS>	<93%>
	Enough to purchase what you have made known.

<CÆSAR>	<93%>
	Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve

</CÆSAR>

<CLEOPATRA>	<93%>
	See! Cæsar! O, behold,
	How pomp is follow'd; mine will now be yours;
	And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
	The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
	Even make me wild. O slave! of no more trust
	Than love that's hir'd. What! goest thou back? thou shalt
	Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
	Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
	O rarely base!
</CLEOPATRA>

<CÆSAR>	<93%>
	Good queen, let us entreat you.
</CÆSAR>

<CLEOPATRA>	<93%>
	O Cæsar! what a wounding shame is this,
	That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
	Doing the honour of thy lordliness
	To one so meek, that mine own servant should
	Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
	Addition of his envy. Say, good Cæsar,
	That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,
	Immoment toys, things of such dignity
	As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
	Some nobler token I have kept apart
	For Livia and Octavia, to induce
	Their mediation; must I be unfolded
	With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
	Beneath the fall I have. <STAGE DIR>
<To Seleucus.>
</STAGE DIR> Prithee, go hence;
	Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits

<CLEOPATRA>	<94%>
	Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought

</CLEOPATRA>

<CÆSAR>	<94%>
	Cleopatra,
	Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,
	Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be 't yours,
	Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
	Cæsar's no merchant, to make prize with you
	Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
	Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
	For we intend so to dispose you as
	Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:

	Immortal longings in me; now no more
	The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
	Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
	Antony call; I see him rouse himself
	To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
	The luck of Cæsar, which the gods give men
	To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
	Now to that name my courage prove my title!
	I am fire, and air; my other elements
	I give to baser life. So; have you done?
	Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
	Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
<STAGE DIR>
<Kisses them. Iras falls and dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
	If thou and nature can so gently part,
	The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
	Which hurts, and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
	If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
	It is not worth leave-taking.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
	Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
	The gods themselves do weep.
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<98%>
	This proves me base:
	If she first meet the curled Antony,
	He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
	Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
<STAGE DIR>
<To the asp, which she applies to her breast.>
</STAGE DIR>
	With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
	Of life at once untie; poor venomous fool,
	Be angry, and dispatch. O! couldst thou speak,
	That I might hear thee call great Cæsar ass
	Unpolicied.
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
	O eastern star!
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<98%>
	Peace, peace!
	Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
	That sucks the nurse asleep?
</CLEOPATRA>

<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
	O, break! O, break!
</CHARMIAN>

<CLEOPATRA>	<98%>
	As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,—
	O Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too.
<STAGE DIR>
<Applying another asp to her arm.>
</STAGE DIR>
	What should I stay—
</CLEOPATRA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>

<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
	In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
	Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
	A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
	And golden Phœbus never be beheld
	Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
	I'll mend it, and then play.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Guard, rushing in.>
</STAGE DIR>
<GUARD 1>	<98%>
	Where is the queen?
</GUARD 1>

<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
	Speak softly, wake her not.
</CHARMIAN>

<GUARD 1>	<98%>
	Cæsar hath sent—
</GUARD 1>

<CHARMIAN>	<98%>
	Too slow a messenger.
<STAGE DIR>
<Applies an asp.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O! come apace, dispatch; I partly feel thee.
</CHARMIAN>

<GUARD 1>	<99%>
	Approach, ho! All's not well; Cæsar's beguil'd.
</GUARD 1>

<GUARD 2>	<99%>
	There's Dolabella sent from Cæsar; call him.
</GUARD 2>

<GUARD 1>	<99%>
	What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
</GUARD 1>

<CHARMIAN>	<99%>
	It is well done, and fitting for a princess
	Descended of so many royal kings.
	Ah! soldier.
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>

</CHARMIAN>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Dolabella.>
</STAGE DIR>
<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
	How goes it here?
</DOLABELLA>

<GUARD 2>	<99%>
	All dead.
</GUARD 2>

<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
	Cæsar, thy thoughts
	Touch their effects in this; thyself art coming
	To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
	So sought'st to hinder.
<STAGE DIR>
<Within, 'A way there!—a way for Cæsar!'>
</STAGE DIR>

</DOLABELLA>
<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Cæsar and all his Train.>
</STAGE DIR>
<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
	O! sir, you are too sure an augurer;
	That you did fear is done.
</DOLABELLA>

<CÆSAR>	<99%>
	Bravest at the last,
	She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
	Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
	I do not see them bleed.
</CÆSAR>

<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
	Who was last with them?
</DOLABELLA>

<GUARD 1>	<99%>
	A simple countryman that brought her figs:
	This was his basket.
</GUARD 1>

<CÆSAR>	<99%>
	Poison'd then.
</CÆSAR>

<GUARD 1>	<99%>
	O Cæsar!
	This Charmian liv'd but now; she stood, and spake:
	I found her trimming up the diadem
	On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,
	And on the sudden dropp'd.
</GUARD 1>

<CÆSAR>	<99%>
	O noble weakness!
	If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
	By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
	As she would catch another Antony
	In her strong toil of grace.
</CÆSAR>

<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
	Here, on her breast,
	There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
	The like is on her arm.
</DOLABELLA>

<GUARD 1>	<100%>
	This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
	Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
	Upon the caves of Nile.
</GUARD 1>

<CÆSAR>	<100%>
	Most probable
	That so she died; for her physician tells me
	She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
	Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
	And bear her women from the monument.
	She shall be buried by her Antony:
	No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
	A pair so famous. High events as these
	Strike those that make them; and their story is
	No less in pity than his glory which
	Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall,
	In solemn show, attend this funeral,
	And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
	High order in this great solemnity.
</CÆSAR>
